<P>The Positions<br>
There are three positions you can apply for at a Camp in Canada. They are general camp counselor, activities camp counselor and support staff. While the counselor positions are the most
popular and have you working closely with the children, all positions need you to be highly energetic and outgoing. Theses positions are great opportunities to boost your skills, add international work
to your CV and to immerse yourself in the Canadian culture.
The Application Process
Applying to Camp Canada is quite simple and throughout the process we are there to help you through. If you have any questions along the way one of our staff members are always ready and willing
to answer them.
Stage One: Application and Interview
To apply to the programme you’ll need to make the first stage payment for £69, this shows commitment to the programme and covers the cost of the interview.. Once this payment is made, you’ll
receive an application. After you have complete your application and returned it back to the team, we’ll review your application and, if you are a rock star on paper, invite you to do an interview with
either a member of staff or your local campus manager. These interviews are informal, but informative meetings that allow us to get to know you and your skills better so that we can ensure you have
the strongest application possible and that we have the correct information about you to match you up with the right camp.
Stage Two: Documentation
Once the interview is done you will have 14 days to submit the rest of your application, 3 references and a short application video. This is how the Camp Directors in Canada will get to know what kind
of person you are on a personal level so make sure you talk about your skills in your video and include a few photos of you doing them. The references cannot be from friends or family members and
must contain active contact details so we can verify them. Teachers, employers or coaches are the best references to fill out the forms.
This part of the process is when we work hard to match you with the best camp for you and then get you prepared to make your way to Canada. You will either be placed through our system or at one
of our Camp Fairs. These fairs are great opportunities to have more control over the camp you will be placed at and have the possibility to be placed with a friend. At these fairs you will meet face to
Once you have been placed it is now time to make your final payment, get your medical and visa and book your flights. You do NOT have to attend an embassy interview to obtain your visa. Visas ar
face with the Camp Directors and show off your amazing personality and brag about your skills.
Once you have been placed it is now time to make your final payment, get your medical and visa and book your flights. You do NOT have to attend an embassy interview to obtain your visa. Visas are
done online and you get it when you go through customs in Canada. Flights are quite easy too and we can get you in contact with our flight partner to help you book them. It is best to apply early so
you can get placed earlier, book flights earlier and get a cheaper rate
Orientation
You will attend an orientation in the UK so you know exactly what to expect when you get to Canada. Once you arrive in the host city of the province you will be working in, the Camp Canada team will meet you. During this time you will
meet other international staff, open your Canadian bank account and apply for your Social Insurance Number. The camps will then come and pick you up from this
location saving you the hassle of finding your way to camp.</P>
